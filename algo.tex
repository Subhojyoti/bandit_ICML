\textbf{The algorithm.} As mentioned in a recent work \cite{liu2016modification}, UCB-Improved has two shortcomings: 	\\
\begin{inparaenum}[\bfseries(i)]
\item A significant number of pulls are spent in early exploration, since each round $m$ of UCB-Improved involves pulling every arm an identical $n_{m}=\bigg\lceil \frac{ 2\log(T\epsilon^{2}_{m})}{\epsilon^{2}_{m}} \bigg\rceil$ number of times. The quantity $\epsilon_{m}$ is initialized to $1$ and halved after every round.\\
\item In UCB-Improved, arms are eliminated conservatively, i.e, only after $\epsilon_{m}<\frac{\Delta_{i}}{2}$, the sub-optimal arm $i$ is discarded with high probability. This is disadvantageous when $K$ is large and the gaps are identical ($r_{1}=r_{2}=\cdots=r_{K-1}<r^{*}$) and small.\\
\end{inparaenum}
To reduce early exploration, the number of times $n_m$ each arm is pulled per round in ClusUCB is lower than that of UCB-Improved and also that of Median-Elimination, which used $n_m=\frac{4}{\epsilon^{2}}\log\big(\frac{3}{\delta}\big)$, where $\epsilon,\delta$ are confidence parameters.
To handle the second problem mentioned above, ClusUCB partitions the larger problem into several small sub-problems using clustering and then performs local exploration aggressively to eliminate sub-optimal arms within each clusters with high probability.


As described in the pseudocode in Algorithm~\ref{alg:clusucb}, ClusUCB begins with a initial clustering of arms that is performed by random uniform allocation. The set of clusters $S$ thus obtained satisfies $|S|=p$, with individual clusters having a size that is bounded above by $\ell=\left\lceil \frac{K}{p} \right\rceil$.
Each round of ClusUCB involves both individual arm as well as cluster elimination conditions. These elimination conditions are inspired by UCB-Improved. Notice that, unlike UCB-Improved, there is no longer a single point of reference based on which we are eliminating arms. Instead we now have as many reference points to eliminate arms as number of clusters formed. 
%Further, the exploration factors $\rho_{a}\in (0,1]$ and $\rho_{s}\in (0,1]$ governing the arm and cluster elimination conditions, respectively, are relatively more aggressive than that in UCB-Improved. 

The exploration regulatory factor $\psi$ governing the arm and cluster elimination conditions in ClusUCB is more aggressive than that in UCB-Improved. With appropriate choices of $\psi$, $\rho_a$ and $\rho_s$, we can achieve aggressive elimination even when the gaps $\Delta_i$ are small and $K$ is large. 

%and the gaps $\Delta_i$ are small, it is efficient to remove sub-optimal arms quickly. 

In \citet{liu2016modification}, the authors recommend incorporating a factor of $d_i$ inside the log-term of the UCB values, i.e., $\max \lbrace\hat{r}_{i}+\sqrt{\frac{d_{i}\log T{\epsilon}_{m}^{2}}{2n_{m}}}\rbrace$. 
The authors there examine the following choices for $d_i$: $\frac{T}{z_{i}}$, $\frac{\sqrt{T}}{z_{i}}$ and $\frac{\log T}{z_{i}}$, where $z_{i}$ is the number of times an arm ${i}$ has been sampled.
Unlike \citet{liu2016modification}, we employ cluster as well as arm elimination and establish from a theoretical analysis that the choice $\psi=\frac{T}{196\log (K)}$ helps in achieving a better gap-dependent regret upper bound for ClusUCB as compared to UCB-Improved and MOSS (see Corollary \ref{Result:Corollary:1} in section \ref{sec:results}). 


%Like our exploration regulatory factor $\psi$, a similar topic has already been handled in \cite{liu2016modification} where they have introduced mainly three types of regulatory factors($d_{i}$) to the term $\max \lbrace\hat{r}_{i}+\sqrt{\frac{d_{i}\log T\tilde{\Delta}_{m}^{2}}{2n_{m}}}$ which is used for selecting an arbitrary arm ${i}$ in the $t$-th timestep. This regulatory term $d_{i}$ can be of the form as $\frac{T}{t_{i}}$, $\frac{\sqrt{T}}{t_{i}}$ and $\frac{\log T}{t_{i}}$, where $t_{i}$ is the number of times an arm ${i}$ has been sampled. One has to choose a regulatory factor based on how fast the algorithm should taper its exploration in the later rounds.

%since with time, $t_{i}$ increases and only the numerator decides how fast the exploration must decrease.

%Discussion on UCB-V, not quite sure
%In this context we must also point out a similar discussion on the arm elimination parameters was handled in \cite{audibert2009exploration}(section $5.1$). There the authors proved that by introducing the factor $\rho$ in the confidence interval term of UCB1 such that $c=\sqrt{\frac{\rho\log T}{n_{i}}}$, where $n_{i}$ is the number of times the arm $a_{i}$ has been sampled, we can make the expected regret $\E [R_{T}]$ linearly dependent on $\rho$. So this $\rho$ in the confidence term controls the exploration and larger the $\rho$, higher is the exploration. In the original UCB1 algorithm this coefficient was set to $\rho=2$. In ClusUCB, both $\rho_{a}$ and $\rho_{s}$ are taken to be $\leq 1$. 


%For creating these clusters we rely on the parameter $\epsilon_{m}$, which is initialized at $1$ and halved after every round. 
%$\hat{\Delta}_{m}$(in which all $\hat{r}_{i}$ lies) divided by $\ell$. 
%If the range before any round is found to be $0$ then we conduct a small exploration with the alternate definition of $\epsilon_{m}=\frac{1}{D_{m}}$. 
%Thus, we see that as the rounds progresses, $\epsilon_{m}$ gets smaller and smaller resulting in tighter and tighter clusters with high purity level. Single link clustering tends to create large clusters with many elements in a single cluster. To avoid this behavior, mainly because we are conducting exploration inside a cluster based on its size, we bound the maximum cluster size possible in any round by $\ell=\min\lbrace 2^{m}, K \rbrace$. Hence as $\epsilon_{m}$ tends to $\Delta$ the upper limit on the cluster size gets fixed. 



%Also our total regret depends on how many arms has survived till $m$-th round and so we don't need to keep track on the number of clusters formed.

%Through cluster elimination condition we ensure that the stopping condition is reached faster. This is a much aggressive elimination condition and in the proofs we give a further analysis on why this works. The parameter $\rho\in (0,1]$ in the confidence interval actually makes the cluster elimination a faster elimination condition than the elimination condition in UCB-Improved.
	
%This is a parameter which we use to tune our exploration and we define its structure later in the proofs. There is also the weight($w_{s_{i}}$) parameter which   is calculated online and helps in eliminating arms with a higher probability which we employ to reduce the cumulative regret and this parameter is decide online specific to the cluster $s_{i}\in S$.
